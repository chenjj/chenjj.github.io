      <description>Introduction Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are important Internet infrastructure and improve the performance, scalability and security for websites. Therefore, attacks against availability of CDNs affect the reachability to a large amount of web sites.
In this study, we present how malicious customers could attack the availability of CDN by creating forwarding loops inside one CDN or across multiple CDNs. Such forwarding loops cause one request to be processed repeatedly or even indefinitely, resulting in undesired resource consumption and potentially Denial-of-Service attacks.</description>
